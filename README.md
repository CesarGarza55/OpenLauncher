**Note**: Currently, OpenLauncher is designed only for Windows and Linux.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning for Windows Users

**Warning**: On Windows, the launcher may be flagged as a false positive by antivirus software due to the absence of a valid certificate. Please be assured that this is a false alarm and the software is safe to use.

If you encounter issues downloading the [installer](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/releases/latest/download/OpenLauncher.exe), consider using the [portable](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/releases/latest/download/OpenLauncher-Portable-Windows.zip) version as an alternative.

I have scanned the launcher with VirusTotal, and it was not detected by any antivirus engine. You can view the scan results below.

![VirusTotal Scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5685f609-36d1-432f-b628-a25cb916312b)

The installed executable of the launcher has also been scanned with VirusTotal and shows no issues.

![VirusTotal Scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b7aa152-5f54-4457-9273-7c955cf85a4e)


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning for Linux Users

**Warning**: On Linux, you may need to install all the dependencies first. You can use the script `dependencies.sh` to install them, or run `compile-linux.sh` and select "Install dependencies only" to install them.

If you want to install the dependencies and download the compiled version from the releases, use [this file](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/blob/main/dependencies.sh). 
If you are going to compile it yourself, the process is included in `compile-linux.sh`.

## üöÄ Features

- **Microsoft Account Login**: Supports logging in with an official Microsoft account.
- **Discord Rich Presence**: Displays fun messages while you play.
- **Customizable Interface**: Utilizes PyQt5 for a modern and customizable look.
- **Minecraft Compatibility**: Manages Minecraft versions using the `minecraft_launcher_lib` library.
- **Open Source**: Easily extendable and modifiable by the community.
- **Multiplatform**: Available for Windows and Linux operating systems.
- **Multilanguage Support**: Supports multiple languages for a better user experience.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Java
- pip (Python package manager)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Windows

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher.git
    cd OpenLauncher
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

3. Compile:
   
    1. Run the `compile-windows.bat` script to compile the project.

    ```bash
    compile-windows.bat
    ```

    2. Make installer (optional)
        1. Ensure NSIS is installed on your system. You can download NSIS from [nsis.sourceforge.io](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download).
        2. Open NSIS and click on "Compile NSI scripts":

        ![NSIS Compile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daba00d4-e5ee-46e6-9f41-14f60e8e3b7d)

        3. Click on "Load Script..." to load the `script/compile.nsi` script file.

        Alternatively, use the `compile-compress.nsi` script to reduce installer size by ~30 MB, though it will increase build time.

        ![NSIS Load Script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22c5b691-51f9-4fcf-a25c-563705402200)
        
        4. Once the compilation is successful, open the output file OpenLauncher.exe to begin the installation.

4. You need to install Java to be able to play:

    [https://www.java.com/es/download/](https://www.java.com/es/download/)

### Linux

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher.git
    cd OpenLauncher
    ```
    
2. Compile:
    
    Execute the script to start the compilation process:

    ```bash
    ./compile-linux.sh
    ```

3. Mark the file as an executable (For Generic Linux systems)

![Executable](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/assets/168610828/37588648-144d-4b0f-83c8-3dde1d683786)

Or run:

   ```bash
   chmod +x OpenLauncher.bin
   ```

4. Execute

   1. For Generic Linux systems
   ```bash
   ./OpenLauncher.bin
   ```

   2. For Debian based systems
   ```bash
   openlauncher
   ```

## üì• Download options

- Windows Installer: .exe
- Linux Installer (Debian/Ubuntu): .deb
- Linux Generic (compiled): .bin


## üïπÔ∏è Usage

When you open the application, a welcome window greets you. You can disable this feature using a checkbox.

<img width="994" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c22dd45-2b25-45c3-8968-a35ddcb21002" />

The main interface shows different sections:

<img width="994" height="600" alt="main" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24609e8-7d7e-48f5-8642-ecd4cf258c10" />

To install a version, use the following interface where you select the version and click install:

<img width="994" height="600" alt="install" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6310e4b3-0b6c-4c7b-94d3-f5169d0b68ed" />

By default the following JVM arguments are used:

   ```bash
   -Xmx2G -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M
   ```

If you want to change something you need to do it from the settings window.

## üêû Bugs

There was previously a minor bug that caused the launcher to close when installing versions or running the game. This was due to how subprocesses are managed, and IN THEORY, this issue has been fixed as of beta-1.5.1. However, if the error persists, please report it in the issues section, and I will continue working to resolve it.

Keeping the software bug-free is challenging since it‚Äôs designed to work with both Windows and Linux. With so many Linux distributions out there, it‚Äôs especially complex to manage compatibility across such a wide variety of systems.

## üêß Linux errors

In some distributions, errors may occur due to the wide variety of systems available. If the executable does not open or fails to display anything when you run it, this may be due to an incompatibility or missing dependencies. To help identify the error and provide a possible solution in the future, you can run the application directly from the terminal using './OpenLauncher.bin' or 'openlauncher' if you installed the .deb package.

For example, in Debian 12, when you try to open the application, no error message may appear, but the application does not launch. This issue is caused by the version of Python being used. The easiest way to resolve this is by compiling the package yourself. See [compilation on Linux](#linux).

Example of the error:

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5e56835-95a8-457a-a45c-cc6a11e56d03)

Also, for example on fedora, you can get this error:

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c67d8fc3-c61b-4ec9-b084-c98d2ab1bc39)

**It's recommended to compile the launcher on your own to avoid issues.**
