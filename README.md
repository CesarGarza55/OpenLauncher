**Note**: Currently, OpenLauncher is designed only for Windows and Linux.

## ⚠️ Warning for Windows Users

**Warning**: On Windows, the launcher may be flagged as a false positive by antivirus software due to the absence of a valid certificate. Please be assured that this is a false alarm and the software is safe to use.

If you encounter issues downloading the [installer](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/releases/latest/download/OpenLauncher.exe), consider using the [portable](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/releases/latest/download/OpenLauncher-Portable-Windows.zip) version as an alternative.

I have scanned the launcher with VirusTotal, and it was not detected by any antivirus engine. You can view the scan results below.

![VirusTotal Scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5685f609-36d1-432f-b628-a25cb916312b)

The installed executable of the launcher has also been scanned with VirusTotal and shows no issues.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Java
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Windows

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher.git
    cd OpenLauncher
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

3. Compile:
   
    1. Run the `compile-windows.bat` script to compile the project.
   
    `compile-windows.bat`:
    ```bash
    @echo off
    py -m pip install -r data/requirements_windows.txt
    python compile.py build
    
    echo OpenLauncher compiled successfully!
    echo You can create the installer with NSIS by running the compile .nsi file with NSIS.
    echo Press any key to exit...
    pause >nul
    ```
    2. Ensure NSIS is installed on your system. You can download NSIS from [nsis.sourceforge.io](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download).
    3. Open NSIS and click on "Compile NSI scripts":

       ![NSIS Compile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daba00d4-e5ee-46e6-9f41-14f60e8e3b7d)

    4. Click on "Load Script..." to load the `script/compile.nsi` script file.

       Alternatively, use the `compile-compress.nsi` script to reduce installer size by ~30 MB, though it will increase build time.

       ![NSIS Load Script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22c5b691-51f9-4fcf-a25c-563705402200)
    
    5. Once the compilation is successful, open the output file OpenLauncher.exe to begin the installation.

4. You need to install Java to be able to play:

    [https://www.java.com/es/download/](https://www.java.com/es/download/)

### Linux

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher.git
    cd OpenLauncher
    ```
    
2. Compile:
   1. For Debian / Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    # Create the directory structure
    DEST_DIR="compile-deb/usr/share/openlauncher"
    mkdir -p "$DEST_DIR"

    # Compile the source code if the binary does not exist
    if [ ! -f "OpenLauncher.bin" ]; then
        echo "OpenLauncher.bin is not compiled yet and will be compiled now"
        chmod +x compile-linux.sh
        ./compile-linux.sh
        echo "OpenLauncher.bin is compiled successfully and ready to be packaged"
    else
        rm OpenLauncher.bin
        echo "OpenLauncher.bin will be recompiled to ensure the latest version is packaged"
        chmod +x compile-linux.sh
        ./compile-linux.sh
        echo "OpenLauncher.bin is compiled successfully and ready to be packaged"
    fi

    # Copy the necessary files
    cp OpenLauncher.bin "$DEST_DIR"

    # Ensure the binary is executable
    chmod +x "$DEST_DIR/OpenLauncher.bin"

    # Ensure the permissions are set correctly
    chmod -R 0755 compile-deb

    # Compile the deb package
    dpkg-deb --build compile-deb "OpenLauncher.deb"

    # Ask the user if they want to install the package
    read -p "Do you want to install the package? [y/n]: " INSTALL
    if [ "$INSTALL" == "y" ]; then
        sudo dpkg -i "OpenLauncher.deb"
    fi
    
    # Remove the binary from the destination directory
    rm "$DEST_DIR/OpenLauncher.bin"
    ```
    
    Next, execute the script to start the compilation process:

    ```bash
    ./compile-debian.sh
    ```

   2. For Generic Linux systems:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    # Colors
    GREEN='\033[0;32m'
    BLUE='\033[0;34m'
    RED='\033[0;31m'
    YELLOW='\033[0;33m'
    NC='\033[0m' # No Color

    # Create a virtual environment if it doesn't exist
    if ! command -v python3 &> /dev/null; then
        echo -e "${YELLOW}python3 is not installed and will be installed now${NC}"
        sudo apt install -y python3
    fi

    if ! dpkg -l | grep -q python3-venv; then
        echo -e "${YELLOW}python3-venv is not installed and will be installed now${NC}"
        sudo apt install -y python3-venv
    fi

    VENV_DIR="venv"
    if [ ! -d "$VENV_DIR" ]; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}Creating virtual environment...${NC}"
        python3 -m venv "$VENV_DIR"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo -e "${RED}Failed to create virtual environment${NC}"
            exit 1
        fi else
        echo -e "${GREEN}Virtual environment already exists${NC}"
    fi

    # Check if the virtual environment was created successfully
    if [ ! -f "$VENV_DIR/bin/activate" ]; then

    # Check if pip is installed in the virtual environment
    if ! command -v pip &> /dev/null; then
        echo -e "${RED}pip is not installed in the virtual environment... Exiting${NC}"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Install dependencies
    echo -e "${GREEN}Installing dependencies...${NC}"
    pip install -r data/requirements_linux.txt

    # Install the necessary libraries if not already installed
    LIBRARIES=("libxcb-xinerama0" "libxcb1" "libx11-xcb1" "libxrender1" "libfontconfig1" "libqt5widgets5" "libqt5gui5" "libqt5core5a")

    for LIB in "${LIBRARIES[@]}"; do
        if ! dpkg -l | grep -q "$LIB"; then
            echo -e "${GREEN}Installing $LIB...${NC}"
            sudo apt install -y "$LIB"
        else
            echo -e "${GREEN}$LIB is already installed${NC}"
        fi
    done

    # Export the QT_QPA_PLATFORM variable

    # Remove the temporary files
    echo -e "${GREEN}Cleaning up...${NC}"
    rm OpenLauncher.bin.spec
    rm -rf temp

    # Deactivate the virtual environment
    echo -e "${GREEN}Deactivating virtual environment...${NC}"
    deactivate
    ```

    Next, execute the script to start the compilation process:

    ```bash
    ./compile-linux.sh
    ```

3. You need to install Java to be able to play, by default it should be possible with:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install default-jre
    ```

4. Mark the file as an executable (For Generic Linux systems)

![Executable](https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher/assets/168610828/37588648-144d-4b0f-83c8-3dde1d683786)

Or run:

   ```bash
   chmod +x OpenLauncher.bin
   ```

5. Execute

   1. For Generic Linux systems
   ```bash
   ./OpenLauncher.bin
   ```

   2. For Debian based systems
   ```bash
   openlauncher
   ```

## 📥 Download options

- Windows Installer: .exe
- Linux Installer (Debian/Ubuntu): .deb
- Linux Generic (compiled): .bin

## 🐞 Bugs

There was previously a minor bug that caused the launcher to close when installing versions or running the game. This was due to how subprocesses are managed, and IN THEORY, this issue has been fixed as of beta-1.5.1. However, if the error persists, please report it in the issues section, and I will continue working to resolve it.

Keeping the software bug-free is challenging since it’s designed to work with both Windows and Linux. With so many Linux distributions out there, it’s especially complex to manage compatibility across such a wide variety of systems.

## 🐧 Linux errors

In some distributions, errors may occur due to the wide variety of systems available. If the executable does not open or fails to display anything when you run it, this may be due to an incompatibility or missing dependencies. To help identify the error and provide a possible solution in the future, you can run the application directly from the terminal using './OpenLauncher.bin' or 'openlauncher' if you installed the .deb package.

For example, in Debian 12, when you try to open the application, no error message may appear, but the application does not launch. This issue is caused by the version of Python being used. The easiest way to resolve this is by compiling the package yourself.

Example of the error:
